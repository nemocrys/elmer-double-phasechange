Moving bulk elements to boundary elements
Leading bulk elementtype is 303
Trailing bulk elementtype is 202
There are 100 (out of 840) lower dimensional elements.
Node 27 belongs to maximum of 8 elements
Found 20 side elements that have two parents.
Found correctly 100 side elements.
Parent elements were reordered up to index 740.
Moved 740 elements (out of 840) to new positions
Successfully read the mesh from the Gmsh input file.
Using physical numbering of entities

Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
-------------------------------------------

Elmergrid saving data with method 2:
-------------------------------------
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory case.
Saving 411 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 740 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
Saving names info to mesh.names.
Saving entities info to entities.sif.
